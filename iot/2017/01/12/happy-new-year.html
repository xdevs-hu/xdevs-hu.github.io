<p>… or at least that is what they say.</p>

<p>New years has not always been celebrated on the 1st of January in history. During the Roman calendar, it was celebrated on 1st of March but then there were only ten months in a year. The first the new year was celebrated was in 153 BC in Rome. As we know the Roman in the Roman age that would relate going make changes and this is the reason the new year changed to January. It is believed by many to be the name of the god of transitions and beginnings Janus.</p>

<p>In history, there have been times when the new year was celebrated on December 25, the birth of Jesus. The history to find exactly was have been confusing when we look backwards. But now we find ourselves lucky that we have a fixed number of days and fix date where all celebrate.</p>

<p>It was finally in 1582 when the Gregorian calendar decided to fix January 1 as the New year. In the early Roman era, the 1 st of January was celebrated with a feast as an anniversary of the Mother of God.</p>

<p>The global power in 16-19 century known to be controlling most parts of the world the British Empire where the sun never sets followed their calendar until 1752. Now almost all world follow the Gregorian calendar and things are much easier now.</p>

<h3 id="why-we-celebrate-new-year">Why We Celebrate New Year?</h3>

<p>If we never had a new year what would we do? We would not know when the year begins as well as when it ends so no birthdays, not festivals. New year celebrate not just in social life but as well as business people share stories of the year that has gone by hoping the coming year even to be more exciting. Every business usually releases it yearly work that doesn’t during the past year.</p>

<p>The new year was celebrated as a religious feast, but now in present time we have given more importance to New years Eve that is on 31st of December. The new years Eve is usually celebrated with loved ones either with a night out or a gathering family wishing everyone a better year to come.</p>
